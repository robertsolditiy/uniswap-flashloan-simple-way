A flash loan is an uncollateralized loan you can take out and needs to be repaid before the transaction ends. Flash loans are offered by Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.Flash loans are also called atomic loans. If the sequence of operations that make up a transaction are indivisible or irreducible, it is considered atomic. It means that all the conditions must be met to record that atomic transaction on the blockchain.

While the essence of cryptocurrency lies in the decentralized nature of the blockchain networks, only a small portion of the total trading volume for crypto assets is handled by decentralized exchanges. To make decentralized exchanges more accessible, the market could use more arbitrage trading, which can aid price discovery and liquidity.
